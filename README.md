# Setup a Cloud based Deep Learning Environment leveraging GPUs

In this guide, we will look at a structured tutorial towards setting up a cloud based deep learning enviroment with GPU computing enabled. The idea is to enable you with a deep learning environment which can be accessed from anywhere thanks to the cloud and also help you rapidly prototype deep learning models thanks to the power of GPU based computing. Of course you can always build your models using CPU here too but the idea is to speed-up training times using GPU especially for resource hogging models like RNNs and LSTMs.
